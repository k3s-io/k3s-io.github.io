# **k3s** Community!

## Community Meetings 

We have two community meetings per month:

Every **Second** Tuesday at 10:00 am PST.  
Every **Third** Tuesday at 11:00 am CET.  

Meeting join links can be found on the [Linux Foundation Project Calendar](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/k3s?view=week).
 
We will use this time to communicate project updates, listen to feedback from the K3s community, and collect requirement/use cases for new features. Note: this is not a time to seek technical support or assistance in troubleshooting issues.
